# Running the application

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run in the root of the repository `docker compose up --build`. If there are any issues getting things to run properly, please contact us. You are not expected to fix the Docker configurations.

Open `localhost:8000`. Look for the admin's username and password in [`back/data.json`](./back/data.json), and use that to enter the user management interface.
