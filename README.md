# Running the application locally

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. It is recommended to use GitHub Codespaces to work with this repository, as that has these 2 tools installed, and the repository was already tested there. GitHub Codespaces is a cloud development environment that is free for the first 60 hours, which is enough for the purposes of this project.

# User management application

There are 2 types of user accounts: user and admin.

Admins can create, delete and modify users, and users can't do anything.

Please refer to https://github.com/Meshulash/fullstack-assessment/issues for the assignments. You are asked to start with the bug, proceed to the refactor, and end with the feature.
