# Running the application

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run in the root of the repository `docker compose up --build`. If there are any issues getting things to run properly, please contact us. You are not expected to fix the Docker configurations.

Open `localhost:8000`. Look for the admin's username and password in `back/data.json`, and use that to enter the user management interface.

# About the application

Welcome to our generic user management application. This project was created to assess your skills at working with existing code, some of it good, and some of it less good.

There are 2 types of user accounts: user and admin. Admins can create and delete users. The application currently doesn't have any page for normal users, so non-admin users can't do anything.

Please refer to https://github.com/Meshulash/frontend-home-assignment/issues for the assignments.
