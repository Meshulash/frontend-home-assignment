# User management application

There are 2 types of user accounts: user and admin.

Admins can create, delete and modify users, and users can't do anything.

Please refer to https://github.com/Meshulash/fullstack-assessment/issues for the assignments. You are asked to start with the bug, proceed to the refactor, and end with the feature.
